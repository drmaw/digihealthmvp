# DigiHealth — Project Map

This document explains how the DigiHealth codebase is organized.
InshaAllah the effort will pay off.

---

## 1. Core Idea

- Every user is an **individual first** (patient-capable)
- Roles (doctor, owner, manager, etc.) add permissions
- Roles do NOT replace identity, They Give Capabilities

---

## 2. Folder Structure

### /profile
All personal and professional profiles live here.

- patient.html → Individual (personal + health)
- doctor.html → Doctor professional profile
- owner.html → Organization owner profile
- manager.html → Organization manager profile

---

### /organization
Everything related to clinics / hospitals.

- profile.html → Organization profile
- staff.html → Staff management
- queue.html → Daily patient queue
- stats.html → Organization statistics

---

### /appointments
Doctor appointment system.

- create.html → Create appointment
- patient.html → Patient appointment list
- doctor.html → Doctor appointment view
- organization.html → Front desk / clinic view

---

### /records
Medical records system.

- upload.html → Upload medical records
- patient.html → Patient record view
- doctor.html → Doctor record view
- view.html → Unified record viewer

---

### /admin
System governance (admin only).

- audit.html → Audit & change logs
- roles.html → Role & permission management

---

### /js
Shared JavaScript logic.

- auth-guard.js → Login & role protection
- roles.js → Role helpers
- appointments.js → Appointment logic
- records.js → Medical record logic
- organization.js → Organization logic
- utils.js → Common helpers

---

## 3. Backend (Firebase)

- Authentication → Firebase Auth
- Database → Firestore
- Files → Firebase Storage
- Rules → firestore.rules

---

## 4. Important Rule

If you are confused:
1. Find the **HTML page**
2. See which **JS file** it uses
3. Check **Firestore collection**
4. Check **Firestore rules**

This system is designed to be readable.
